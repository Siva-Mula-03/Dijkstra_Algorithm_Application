Q. For the map given below, find the least compromising route such that its cost saving as well as time saving. Explain your implementation in detail. The price estimation is done using the following metrics: 
(I) For every Km travelled, it costs $0.45 in fuel.
(II) For every hour spent on the road, it costs $10 for the driver.
(III) For every hour spent on the pit stops, it costs $25 for expenditures.
The distance mentioned is 1000Km times the unit present. It's not for scale. 

Calculate the best route where a driver starts from each city individually and returns back to the same city. Ex: case-1 - Driver starts from bangalore and travels all cities exactly once and returns back to bangalore ; case-2 - Driver starts from mumbai and returns back to mumbai after visiting all cities exactly once, etc.
Do this for all 6 cities and determine which city would be the best to begin with. [Hyderabad is C]

The wait times for each cities are (in hours)-
A - 4
B - 7
C - 3
D - 2
E - 1
F - 5

Speed limit enforced is 80 Kmph and is not allowed to exceed that.
